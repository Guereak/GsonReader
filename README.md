# GsonReader
A simple yet easy to use C# JSON Library <br/>
This project was intended for a single case use (working with IPRegistry API) and does not support arrays or type recognition. (it may in the future) <br/>
It returns a dictionnary of strings (`Gson.subCategory`) which you can then use to retrieve the data. <br/>
<br/>
Feel free to contribute if you are brave enough.
